Learning is the highest honor
because the unknown is something we need to understand
even if it alludes us.
Having determination in front of us
is fueled by those who have gone before us.
Our simple risk of failure is nothing compared to the reward.
But the alternative of risk
is stagnation,
regression,
and irrelvancy.
Not growing, even going backward, is worse
than any small struggle to achieve.
Being brave through our fear is self-defining.
